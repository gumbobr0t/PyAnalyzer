# PyAnalyzer
Simple python script utilizing pycdc and pyinstxtractor to decompile and disassemble pyinstaller packed executables.

⚠️**You might need to build the pycdc executable yourself and place it inside the `resources` folder, because it does not work on every system.**

Example usage:
`python main.py FILE_TO_ANALYZE.exe`

Thanks to zrax and extremecoders for the disassemblers and unpackers.
